strange rocks
score: 


reflection to find text that is supposed to be translatable? —attribute based or specified in a config file?  Too much?


translatableTextMesh — could just move them all over




So basic workflow is that TranslationUtility will send OnLoacalize — broadcast — not wonderful, but not sure how much worse it is than searching all things and then 


All OnLocalize() get set
globalizeTextMesh in scene files


XXXX as ignored or SCORE: XXXX => “Score: {0}”


TODO: upload all foreign translations(not just source) before requesting a translation

retrieving translations — poll?  set a timer?
